# empress

**Let your Liberty be confined**

A simple utility to start en stop your Open Liberty servers

## Features

Manage your created, Open Liberty servers conveniently from the explorer view, with all of the following features:

* Start a server
* Stop a server

## Requirements

Open liberty needs to be install (unzipped) to a location on a local drive.

Currently only tested on Linux. I haven't booted to Windows in a while. It will probably need to a lot of updates. That's no problem on a Linux OS, but on Windows it may take while. And then it will need to reboot in between the updates and automatically boot to Linux instead of Windows, so I will need to manually boot to Windows again... rinse and repeat

I'm pretty sure it doesn't work on Windows anyway, because there are a bin/server and bin/server.bat file that comes included in an Open Liberty installation. This extension only uses the bin/server file.

It would be nice to have both OS's ... OS' ... OSsies ? \
It would be nice to have both Operating Systems supported, but that would involve the aformentioned ritual

## Extension Settings

There is one setting required for this extension to work:

> empress.openlibertyBaseDirectory
